2.1.0
~~~~~
Main focus of 2.1.0 is to sort out the way IvySvn uses SVNKit and the problems it currently has where, for 
certain patterns, files and folders end up in unexpected places. Once these have been resolved, we can 
advertise IvySvn more publically to the rest of the world by doing some advertising on Java websites and 
mailing lists. This release should also update to the latest version of Ivy and latest version of SVNKit. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-Ask ivy and ivymeetssvn projects to update link to google code site.

-When 2.1.0 - announce on ivy list, javalobby, last.fm blog, IvySvn mailing list etc.

  IvySvn 2.1.0 released - A Subversion Resolver for Ivy.
  
  Summary:
  The 2.1.0 version of IvySvn, a Subversion Resolver for Ivy (Ant's "agile dependency manager"), has been released with 
  upgrades to the version of Ivy it uses as well as various bug fixes and improvements.  
  
  Content:
  The 2.1.0 version of IvySvn is now available for download from http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/
  
  IvySvn is a resolver for Ivy 2.1.0 (http://ant.apache.org/ivy) which uses Subversion for storing artifacts for 
  use by Ivy's publish and retrieve operations. IvySvn is free, open source software released under the Apache license 
  (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
  
  Features in IvySvn 2.1.0 include:
  
  - All repository operations are now relative to Ivy repository root, NOT the Subversion root which allows more fine-grained permissions models among other things. 
  - Upgraded to Ivy 2.1.0, SVNKit 1.3.2 and Trilead SSH for Java build213-svnkit-1.3-patch.
  - Improved Wiki documentation, especially instructions for building from source and unit test setup for developers.
    
  For more information on the new features please refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file which is part of the release.
   
  Thank you to everyone from the open source community (especially the peeps at Apache and Last.fm) who helped 
  contribute to this release by giving feedback, feature ideas, code patches and helping with testing.

Future:
~~~~~~~

-Make commit message configurable (maybe via a file template?)
-Use Google ant tasks for publishing new binary and source releases.
