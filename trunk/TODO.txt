  IvySvn 2.0 released - A Subversion Resolver for Ivy.
  
  Summary:
  The 2.0 version of IvySvn, a Subversion Resolver for Ivy (Ant's "agile dependency manager"), has been released with 
  new features which take advantage of Subversion's diff and transactional commits.  
  
  Content:
  The 2.0 version of IvySvn is now available for download from http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/
  
  IvySvn is a resolver for Ivy 2.0 (http://ant.apache.org/ivy) which uses Subversion for storing artifacts for 
  use in Ivy's publish and retrieve operations. IvySvn is free, open source software released under the <link>
  Apache license.
  
  New features in IvySvn 2.0 include:
  
    - Publish operations can now be configured to publish to an intermediate location, taking 
    advantage of Subversion's diff functionality to reduce storage requirements in Subversion when 
    publishing multiple revisions of the same project.
    
    - Publish operations now result in one Subversion commit per publish (or two commits if using the binary 
    diff feature) instead of one commit per file. This allows Subversion to control Ivy commits better and 
    also allows for better diffs between Subversion revisions. 
    
   - When overwriting existing published artifacts, files that are no longer part of publish are now 
     deleted. 
    
  For more information on the new features please refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file which is part of the release.

  The 2.0 release of IvySvn not only contains many new features but also marks 
  the move of the IvySvn project from <a href="audioscrobbler.net">Audioscrobbler.net</a> 
  to a new home at http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/. Benefits of this move include improved access to the source 
  code, improved documentation in Wiki format and issue tracking. 
    
  Thank you to everyone from the open source community (especially the peeps at Apache and Last.fm) who helped 
  contribute to this release by giving feedback, feature ideas, code patches and helping with testing.


Future:
~~~~~~~

-Test and bundle with Ivy 2.0 jar when released.
-Make commit message configurable (maybe via a file template?)

-Add unit tests!!!
 This could be tricky to test all possible setups but we could at least start with svn:// and file:/// url's. svn+ssh:// 
 and http:// will require more setup and infrastructure to be present to run tests.
 Can go for two approaches:
 
 1. Call ant programmatically from the tests on a variety of ivy.xml files and then check the side effects in svn using svnkit calls.
    see also http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0502_gawor/0502_gawor.html
    Might be tricky as ivy is not a core ant task, not sure how to set up optional tasks. 
 
 2. Call Ivy more directly using code like such (lifted from a discussion on ivy users mailing list):
 
        Ivy ivy = Ivy.newInstance();
        ivy.configureDefault();

        File ivyfile = File.createTempFile("ivy", ".xml");
        ivyfile.deleteOnExit();
        String[] dep = new String[]{"commons-lang", "commons-lang", "1.0"};
        DefaultModuleDescriptor md = DefaultModuleDescriptor
                .newDefaultInstance(ModuleRevisionId.newInstance(dep[0],
                        dep[1] + "-caller", "working"));
        DefaultDependencyDescriptor dd = new DefaultDependencyDescriptor(md,
                ModuleRevisionId.newInstance(dep[0], dep[1], dep[2]), false, false, true);
        md.addDependency(dd);
        XmlModuleDescriptorWriter.write(md, ivyfile);

        String[] confs = new String[]{"default"};
        ResolveOptions resolveOptions = new ResolveOptions().setConfs(confs);
        ResolveReport report = ivy.resolve(ivyfile.toURL(), resolveOptions);
        
 (also have a look at the other unit tests packaged with Ivy itself)
