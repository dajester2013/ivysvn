2.1.0
~~~~~
Main focus of 2.1.0 is to sort out the way IvySvn uses SVNKit and the problems it currently has where, for 
certain patterns, files and folders end up in unexpected places. Once these have been resolved, we can 
advertise IvySvn more publically to the rest of the world by doing some advertising on Java websites and 
mailing lists. This release should also update to the latest version of Ivy (if Ivy 2.1.0 comes out in the same time frame 
which I expect it will) and latest version of SVNKit.

TODO: update example ivy settings on website to use new ivy repository root layout stuff

2.0 to 2.1 upgrade procedure.

http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/issues/detail?id=18

What you will need to change in your ivysettings config file...

- repositoryRoot should now point to the root location of your *Ivy* repository in subversion (not the subversion root).
- your ivy and artifact patterns should now be relative to this Ivy root repository location.

In practise this usually means moving the leading folder structure from the patterns and appending them to the existing repositoryRoot.

e.g. before:

    <svn name="ivysvn" repositoryRoot="svn://localhost/opt/svntest/" userName="${svn.user.name}"
      userPassword="${svn.user.password}">
      <ivy pattern="test/java/repository/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
      <artifact pattern="test/java/repository/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
    </svn>
    
after:

    <svn name="ivysvn" repositoryRoot="svn://localhost/opt/svntest/repo/root/test/java/repository/" userName="${svn.user.name}"
      userPassword="${svn.user.password}"><!--@-->
      <ivy pattern="[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
      <artifact pattern="[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
    </svn>    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



-Ask ivy and ivymeetssvn projects to update link to google code site.

-When 2.1.0 - announce on ivy list, javalobby, last.fm blog, IvySvn mailing list etc.

  IvySvn 2.1.0 released - A Subversion Resolver for Ivy.
  
  Summary:
  The 2.0.0 version of IvySvn, a Subversion Resolver for Ivy (Ant's "agile dependency manager"), has been released with 
  new features which take advantage of Subversion's diff and transactional commits.  
  
  Content:
  The 2.1.0 version of IvySvn is now available for download from http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/
  
  IvySvn is a resolver for Ivy 2.0.0 (http://ant.apache.org/ivy) which uses Subversion for storing artifacts for 
  use in Ivy's publish and retrieve operations. IvySvn is free, open source software released under the <link>
  Apache license.
  
  Features in IvySvn 2.1.0 include:
  
    - Publish operations can now be configured to publish to an intermediate location, taking 
    advantage of Subversion's diff functionality to reduce storage requirements in Subversion when 
    publishing multiple revisions of the same project.
    
    - Publish operations now result in one Subversion commit per publish (or two commits if using the binary 
    diff feature) instead of one commit per file. This allows Subversion to control Ivy commits better and 
    also allows for better diffs between Subversion revisions. 
    
   - When overwriting existing published artifacts, files that are no longer part of publish are now 
     deleted. 
    
  For more information on the new features please refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file which is part of the release.

   
  Thank you to everyone from the open source community (especially the peeps at Apache and Last.fm) who helped 
  contribute to this release by giving feedback, feature ideas, code patches and helping with testing.


Future:
~~~~~~~

-Make commit message configurable (maybe via a file template?)
-Use Google ant tasks for publishing new binary and source releases.
