2.0
~~~
-Get older ivy users to try current HEAD release and see if repository path with more than one folder 
works for them with repositoryPath attribute removed.

-Document new stuff in Wiki - especially binary diff and overwrite and how these work. Give examples. 
Should probably all go in "usage" section along with other ivysettings.xml example fragments

-Review Xavier Hanin's binary diff patch and see how it differs from current code. Mail him any relevant 
questions.

-Does an ivy path with revision not at the end of the path work in our current setup? If not try get working, 
then will also need to catch case where revision is repeated twice.

-Final review of all code, javadoc and documentation.

-Change audioscrobbler site to point to new google code site.
   
-Make a RC release and mail all past ivysvn users and ask them to test it.

-Test RC bin and src release on fresh machine following instructions on website and in README. 

-Ask ivy and ivymeetssvn projects to update link to google code site.

-When 2.0 - announce on ivy list, javalobby etc.


TBD
~~~
-Test and bundle with Ivy 2.0 jar when released.
-Make commit message configurable (maybe via a file template?)
