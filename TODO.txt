  IvySvn 2.0.0 released - A Subversion Resolver for Ivy.
  
  Summary:
  The 2.0.0 version of IvySvn, a Subversion Resolver for Ivy (Ant's "agile dependency manager"), has been released with 
  new features which take advantage of Subversion's diff and transactional commits.  
  
  Content:
  The 2.0.0 version of IvySvn is now available for download from http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/
  
  IvySvn is a resolver for Ivy 2.0.0 (http://ant.apache.org/ivy) which uses Subversion for storing artifacts for 
  use in Ivy's publish and retrieve operations. IvySvn is free, open source software released under the <link>
  Apache license.
  
  New features in IvySvn 2.0.0 include:
  
    - Publish operations can now be configured to publish to an intermediate location, taking 
    advantage of Subversion's diff functionality to reduce storage requirements in Subversion when 
    publishing multiple revisions of the same project.
    
    - Publish operations now result in one Subversion commit per publish (or two commits if using the binary 
    diff feature) instead of one commit per file. This allows Subversion to control Ivy commits better and 
    also allows for better diffs between Subversion revisions. 
    
   - When overwriting existing published artifacts, files that are no longer part of publish are now 
     deleted. 
    
  For more information on the new features please refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file which is part of the release.

  The 2.0.0 release of IvySvn not only contains many new features but also marks 
  the move of the IvySvn project from <a href="audioscrobbler.net">Audioscrobbler.net</a> 
  to a new home at http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/. Benefits of this move include improved access to the source 
  code, improved documentation in Wiki format and issue tracking. 
    
  Thank you to everyone from the open source community (especially the peeps at Apache and Last.fm) who helped 
  contribute to this release by giving feedback, feature ideas, code patches and helping with testing.


Future:
~~~~~~~

-Make commit message configurable (maybe via a file template?)
-Use Google ant tasks for publishing new binary and source releases.
