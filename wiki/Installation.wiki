  # Copy all the third party libraries (Ivy, Trilead and SVNKit) from the "lib" folder to ANT_HOME/lib/ or to somewhere on your CLASSPATH. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Ivy-svn please remove any older versions of these libraries. 
  # Copy ivysvnresolver.jar into ANT_HOME/lib/ or make sure it is on your CLASSPATH.
  # Create a standard ivy.xml file for your project declaring your dependencies, publications etc.
