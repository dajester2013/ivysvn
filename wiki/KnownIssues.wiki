== Publishing over !WebDav ==

Publishing to a Subversion repository over !WebDav using http(s):// where the repository root is more than one folder deep can lead to issues where !IvySvn publishes artifacts to unexpected folder locations. There are a few possible workarounds for this issue:

  * Make a build using the latest trunk code (now contains a preliminary fix).
  * If you are not using the binaryDiff feature, try enabling this.
  * If you are using the binaryDiff feature, try disabling it.
  * Use a repository root that is only one folder deep.
  * Switch to an alternative method off repository access (e.g svn:// or svn+ssh://)
