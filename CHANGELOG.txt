IvySvn Change Log

Release 2.0 2008-05-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Added ability to perform binary diffs (based on code and concepts contributed by Xavier Hanin).
  - Publish now results in one/two svn commits per publish call instead of per file (based on code and 
    concepts contributed by Stephane Bailliez and subsequent fixes by gereedy).
  - Upgraded to Ivy 2.0.0.
  - Upgraded to SVNKit 1.2.2.
  - Upgraded to Trilead SSH for Java - Build 213 (SVNKit-1.2-patch).
  - Made setting of "repositoryRoot" attribute mandatory. This should be full path to root of repository - including 
    protocol - patterns are relative to this. 
  - Modified attributes set on "svn" element in ivysettings.xml to use CamelCase, renamed "port" to "sshPort" and 
    "passphrase" to "sshPassphrase". 
  - Added a "retrieveRevision" attribute to the "svn" element to specify SVN revision to be used for retrieve operations.
  - When overwriting existing publications, files that are no longer part of publish are removed from repository (this 
    can be controlled by the "cleanupPublishFolder" attribute on the "svn" element.
  - Uses proxy settings if specified via Java system properties (contributed by Steve Brown) (http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/issues/detail?id=7).
  - Fixed SSL authentication by adding a "sslPassphrase" attribute to the "svn" element (contributed by Adam Stroud) (http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/issues/detail?id=15)
  - Changed loading of Manifest so it should work on earlier versions of Ant (contributed by jkytomak) (http://code.google.com/p/ivysvn/issues/detail?id=11).
	- Values (other than sshPassphrase and userPassword) set on SvnResolver are trimmed to avoid annoying issues with whitespace.
	- "ivy-init" target in "common-targets.xml" sets a property to prevent itself being called more than once.
	- Java 5 source and binary compatibility.
